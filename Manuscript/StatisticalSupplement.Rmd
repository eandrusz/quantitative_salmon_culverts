Our analysis depends upon a set of quantitative models, each linking our observations of metabarcoding reads or qPCR cycle-threshold values to an underlying concentration of target-species DNA in water samples.

In summary, we (1) use a mock community with a known composition to calibrate our environmental metabarcoding data as described in Shelton et al. 2022. The result is a set of estimated proportions of DNA from each species in each sample. We then (2) relate qPCR cycle-threshold values for a reference species (here, *O. clarkii*) from the same set of samples to a standard curve to yield quantitative estimates of the concentration of our reference species in each sample. We (3) use these absolute estimates of DNA concentration to expand the metabarcoding-derived proportion data into a complete set of quantitative estimates of DNA concentrations for each species in each sample. Finally, we (4) construct a time-series model for these species-specific concentrations, sharing information across creeks and time-points. This allows us to interpolate unobserved data points and more important, to compare our observations to the (counterfactual) expecations for species' DNA concentrations in the absence of a construction project. We detail the statistical details of these steps below.

## Time-Series Model

At a given station in a given creek, there is some distribution of DNA concentration for a species. For simplicity, we focus on a single species and a single station (downstream or upstream) for the moment.

The (log) DNA concentration in creek $i$ at time $t$ is distributed as $Y_{i,t} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_{i,t},\,\sigma^{2})$. We may choose to let $\sigma$ vary across creeks, time points, or with a covariate such as creek flow.

We are interested in how the DNA concentration changes over time, so we assert that the expected value of DNA in a creek at time $t$, $\mu_{i,t}$, depends upon its value in the previous time step $t-1$, in some way. Further, we can let $\mu_{i,t}$ in, say, our focal Padden creek, depend upon the observations in other creeks (i.e., where creek $i \neq \text{Padden}$) if we think that similar environmental and demographic forces are affecting all creeks in similar ways. We can use these inferences to model data we cannot observe directly -- namely, a counterfactual scenario in which a human intervention did not occur -- to estimate the effect of that intervention.

We use a simple, first-order autoregressive (AR(1)) model with $\mu_{i,t}$ as a linear function of $\mu_{i,t-1}$ with slope $\beta$ and intercept $\alpha$. Here, $\beta$ reflects the degree of autocorrelation between time steps $t$ and $t-1$; a stationary model requires $|\beta| \leq 1$. $\alpha$ estimates the shift in the mean, after accounting for autocorrelation, at a given creek and timepoint.

To share information across creeks, we can assert a constant $\beta$ for all creeks within a timepoint -- that is, the abundance of each species' DNA at a given timepoint is similarly dependent upon its abundance at the prior timepoint. Our model would then look like this:

```{=tex}
\begin{align*}
Y_{i,t} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_{i,t},\,\sigma^{2}) \\
\mu_{i,t} = \alpha_{i,t} + \beta_{t}\mu_{i,t-1} 
\end{align*}
```
where the slope term, $\beta$, is shared across creeks for a given time point.

We can add observations from many species and from the two stations per creek -- upstream and downstream of the culvert -- simply by adding subscripts to the model. If we let $d$ be a subscript indicating station ($d = 1 \text{ if downstream, } d = 2 \text{ if upstream}$), and let $j$ be a subscript indicating species across the same set of samples, we have a single overall model of the change in eDNA concentration among species, creeks, timepoints, and stations.

We then add a term, $\gamma$, to explicitly estimate the effect of culvert removal. We index $\gamma$ with an index $r$ reflecting the state of a creek as either being in its undisturbed state ($r = 1$) or else subject to restoration ($r = 2$; only Padden Creek has this designation, and only after October 2021). We estimate $\gamma$ for each species $j$ and each timepoint $t$.

Finally, we add a term, $\eta$, to capture the additional variation in DNA concentration not otherwise explained by the autocorrelation element of the model. Differences between $\eta$ for upstream and downstream stations within a set of time/creek/species observations reflect a combination of differences due to the culvert itself and random process variation.

We complete the model by specifying the prior distributions from which each parameter is drawn, selecting weakly informative priors for each parameter.

```{=tex}
\begin{align*}
 Y_{i,t,d,j} &\sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_{i,t,d,j},\,\sigma^{2})\\
\mu_{i,t,d,j} &= \alpha_{i,t,j} + \beta_{j}\mu_{i,t-1,d,j} + \gamma_{t,j,r} + \eta_{i,t,d,j} \\
\alpha_{i,j,t} &\sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_{\alpha_j}, \sigma_{\alpha})\\
\beta &\sim \mathcal{N}(0, 5) \\
\gamma &\sim \mathcal{N}(0, 5) \\
\sigma &\sim gamma(1,1) \\
\eta &\sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_{\eta}) \\
\sigma_{\eta} &\sim gamma(1,1) \\
\bf{\mu_{\alpha}} &\sim \mathcal{N}(0, 5)
\end{align*}
```
To reflect (in part) the hierarchical structure of our data, we let our intercept terms, $\alpha$ be drawn from species-specific distributions, where each species has a different mean, but all species share a common variance.

The $\eta$ terms are all drawn from a common distribution, representing variation among triplicate biological observations at a creek/time/station.

Note that the time-series model treats DNA concentrations at time zero, $\mu_0$, as a parameter to be estimated freely from the observed data; all subsequent concentrations are a function of the concentration at the previous timestep. Accordingly, we assign a weakly informative prior on $\mu_0$ as well, $\mu_0 \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 5)$. This prior reflects the prior belief that the DNA concentration for each species is between $4.5*10^-5$ and $2.2*10^4$ copies/L with 95% probability.

The $\eta$ term gives us a way of estimating the effects of the culverts themselves on each species, after subtracting out the effects of autocorrelation, and other modeled parameters. The difference between upstream and downstream values of $eta$ for a given species/creek/time yields our estimate of this effect.

This model shares enough information across time points (within a creek) and across creeks (within a time point) that we can use it to infer DNA concentrations that we do not actually observe -- we treat the temporal/spatial points to be inferred as missing data, parameters to be estimated by the larger model.
